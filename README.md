# COVID-19-symptoms-analysis

This analysis is carried out to analyze the symptoms presented by patients with history of COVID-19 as compared to those without the infection.

### Study Design
We included in the study patients from wave three of the COVID-19 survey, including those that had COVID-19 either based on positive test result or strong medical suspicion, and those that did not contract the disease. A stratified random sample, with an approximate size of 26,517, was considered in the analysis. The variables included in the study were sociodemographic characteristics – sex (male and female) and weight in kilogram; signs and symptoms (fever, dry cough, cough with mucus, sore throat, nasal congestion, sneezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, chest tightness,  fatigue, muscle or body ache, skin rash, runny nose, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, and asymptomatic cases); long-standing illness (cancer, cystic fibrosis, Asthma, diabetes, wheezy bronchitis, HIV, infection, depression, obesity, heart disease, recurrent backache and so on) and new conditions linked to COVID-19. Missing values for COVID-19 symptoms and other clinical manifestations were considered as the absence of these characteristics.

### Data Collection
Covid-19 datasets from the UK data services (COVID-19 Survey in Five National Longitudinal Cohort Studies: Millennium Cohort Study, Next Steps, 1970 British Cohort Study and 1958 National Child Development Study, 2020-2021) was used for the analysis, which provide comprehensive data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United Kingdom. The data sets include patients’ Demographic information, clinical characteristics, symptom presentation, and disease outcomes.

### Data Analysis
The following analyses were carried out in this study;

- Descriptive Statistics of the study population and symptoms occurence
- Regression analysis to determine most significant symptoms
- Chi-square statistics to determine association between demographic variables and symptoms
- Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)
- Hierarchical clustering of the MCA to divide patients into cluster based on symptoms expressed
